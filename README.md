# Arbitrage-Betting-Bot
This was an ex alpha project using sportsbet and betfair APIs, basic template open for use.
Uses selenium for browser automation and python to handle APIs

## Strategy
Buy on Sportsbet, Lay on Betfair - only when win is 105% of the lay
Simple :)

## Recommendations
- Move into python file
- Transfer to Rust for faster communication between APIs

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible if your account gets suspended lol
Also pretty sure this version doesn't work - can't share all my secrets - but is a good baseline template ;)
